# About Me #
Hello! I'm Jiazhen Liu, a third-year Robotics Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. I am honored to work with Prof. Harish Ravichandar. My research interests lie in multi-robot task and motion planning and its application in real world. Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my M.S. from University of Pennsylvania and B.E. from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, both majoring in Computer Science. 

I am an amateur artist in my free time, specializing in watercolor. You can find some samples of my paintings <a href="https://vickyliuliu.github.io/files/art_samples.pdf">here</a>
