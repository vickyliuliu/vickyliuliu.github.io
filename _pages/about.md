<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

I'm Jiazhen, an incoming Ph.D. student in Robotics at Georgia Institute of Technology. I will work with [Dr. Harish Ravichandar](https://harishravichandar.com/).

My primary research interest is multi-robot systems. I hold a particular interest in exploring how to coordinate large-scale multi-robot teams towards certain team-level ojectives, in uncertain or even perilous, antagonistic environments. It is my long-term ambition to see these multi-robot systems being deployed to realistic scenarios and making a real world impact. 

Previously, I got my M.S. in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania. I started my research journey on multi-robot systems working with [Dr. Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. in Computer Science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. 

In my free time, as an art fans, I spent hours and hours on painting. 

Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in my research (or paintings!!!).
